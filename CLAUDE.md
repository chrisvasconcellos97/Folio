# Folios — Claude Development Context

## Deployment Rule
**Vercel production branch is `claude/build-folio-desktop-app-XzvZ5`.** Always push to both `main` AND this branch on every commit:
```
git push origin HEAD:main
git push origin HEAD:claude/build-folio-desktop-app-XzvZ5
```
**Do NOT push to any other branches** — every branch push counts toward Vercel's deployment limit. Now on Pro plan so limit is much higher, but still avoid unnecessary branch pushes.

## Deploy Safety Rule (never make Chris clear cache)

The PWA service worker has bitten Chris twice — every deploy must update cleanly without requiring manual cache clears. Permanent guarantees in the codebase:

1. **SW config in `vite.config.js`** — `skipWaiting: true`, `clientsClaim: true`, `cleanupOutdatedCaches: true`. Never remove these.
2. **Explicit registration in `src/main.jsx`** — two redundant update paths because the SW path keeps getting stuck:
   - **Path 1 — `controllerchange` listener.** Canonical signal that a new SW took over. `onNeedRefresh` does NOT fire when `skipWaiting + clientsClaim` are set (no waiting state). First controllerchange on a fresh visit is skipped so first-timers aren't bounced. Belt.
   - **Path 2 — version polling.** Fetches `/` with `cache: "no-store"` on startup, every 3 min, and on visibility change. Extracts the hashed `index-XXXX.js` filename and compares against the one in the page's loaded `<script src>`. If they differ, a new build is live → reload. **Completely independent of the service worker** so it catches updates even when the SW is misbehaving (e.g. user's installed SW predates the controllerchange listener and can't auto-update itself). Suspenders.
   - Both paths converge on a single `triggerReload()` guarded by a `reloading` flag so we never double-fire.
   - Folios autosaves notes / drafts / items, so silent reload is safe. Toast is a brief "Updating Folios…" hint.
   - Never remove either path; never re-add a manual refresh button without explicit reason.
3. **Vercel headers in `vercel.json`** — `/`, `/index.html`, `/sw.js`, `/manifest.webmanifest` all served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`. Hashed assets stay long-cached.
4. **Never gate critical features on cache state.** If the new build needs a fresh shell, the user gets the toast prompt — they never get a broken-looking app.
5. **Before any deploy that changes the SW or the shell — verify `vite.config.js` workbox block + main.jsx `registerSW` block are intact.** If a Patch build touches these files, double-check before merging.

Symptoms of SW staleness: app won't load, blank page, old UI showing despite recent deploy. Fix-in-the-moment: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister, then hard reload. But the system should prevent this from being needed.

## Sanity-Pass Rule (read before claiming a fix is shipped)

Chris has burned cycles on "fixes" that compiled clean but didn't actually fire at runtime — e.g. relying on `onNeedRefresh` when `skipWaiting + clientsClaim` make it never fire. Before declaring any fix done, do a 60-second sanity pass:

1. **Trace the actual runtime sequence, not the apparent one.** For event-driven code, ask: *what literally triggers this callback, and does my config produce that trigger?* Don't assume from a function name.
2. **For library/framework APIs, check the docs or source for trigger conditions** — especially when flags interact (e.g. `autoUpdate` mode + `skipWaiting` + `onNeedRefresh`).
3. **For "this should never happen again" fixes, mentally walk through the failure case** and confirm the new code path catches it. If you can't articulate the trigger sequence in one sentence, you don't understand the fix yet.
4. **For PWA / SW / auth / RLS / cache layers especially** — these are silent-failure surfaces. A build passing ≠ a fix working. The only validation is reasoning about the runtime sequence.
5. **If a previous fix on the same problem already shipped and didn't work, the bar is higher.** Don't try the same shape of solution twice. Re-derive from first principles.

This rule applies to me (Claude) AND to Patch when spawned for batch builds.

## Theme Rule

Folios supports two themes — **dark** (default) and **light**. Any new
UI work MUST support both:

1. **Use the `C` token from `src/lib/colors.js`** — never hardcode hex or
   rgba values for colors that have a token. If a token doesn't exist for
   your need, add it to both palettes in `index.html`'s CSS-vars block
   AND to `colors.js`.
2. **Light-only or dark-only effects** (animations, shadows, halos) must
   be scoped via `[data-theme="light"]` or `[data-theme="dark"]` so the
   other theme renders correctly.
3. **Before claiming a feature done, manually toggle the theme** and
   confirm both palettes render correctly. The toggle lives in Settings →
   Appearance.
4. **The dark theme is canonical for layout decisions; the light theme
   is the spec'd translation.** Light-mode-specific behaviors (hover
   lifts, mark pulse) are part of the light spec — don't backport to
   dark without an explicit instruction.

Mechanics: the palette swap happens via CSS custom properties on
`<html data-theme="…">`. The values live in `index.html`; `src/lib/colors.js`
exports a `C` object whose every property is a `var(--…)` reference, so all
inline `style={{ background: C.surface }}` consumers re-theme instantly with
no remount. Pre-mount theme application is done by an inline `<script>` in
`index.html` (no flash-of-wrong-theme). `useTheme()` reads/writes the
choice, persisting to `localStorage.folio_theme`.

### Light Theme — Open Polish Items

All shipped — see "Folios design system refresh" in Already shipped.

## Font Rule
**Never use Google Fonts CDN.** All fonts must be self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable` packages installed through npm and imported in `src/main.jsx`. Google Fonts calls get blocked by corporate network proxies. Current fonts: `@fontsource-variable/inter`, `@fontsource-variable/fraunces`, `@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono`.

## Mobile Input Rule (never make Chris fight Safari auto-zoom)
**On mobile / touch devices, every `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` must render at >= 16px.** Below 16px, iOS Safari auto-zooms the viewport when the field gets focus — disorienting and slow to recover from. Chris has hit this twice. The permanent guarantee in `index.html`:

```css
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  input:not([type="checkbox"]):not([type="radio"]):not([type="range"]),
  textarea,
  select {
    font-size: 16px !important;
  }
}
```

Rules for new code:
1. **Don't write `fontSize: 14` (or anything < 16) on an input/textarea/select inline style and assume the global rule will save you** — it does, but reviewers shouldn't have to remember that. Use 16 baseline; let typography sing elsewhere (labels, helper text).
2. **Don't remove the `pointer: coarse` block** in `index.html`. If you need to scope it tighter, scope it tighter — don't delete it.
3. **`InputField` / `TextArea` / `SelectField`** in `src/components/InputField.jsx` already default to 16px — prefer them over raw `<input>` whenever practical so the baseline is built in.
4. **Before claiming a mobile UI fix shipped, focus a real input on an iOS device or simulator** and confirm no zoom.

Symptoms of regression: tap an input → viewport visibly zooms in → input loses focus or shifts under the keyboard.

## React Hook Order Rule (App.jsx specifically)

**Every `useState` / `useEffect` / `useMemo` / `useRef` declaration in `src/App.jsx` MUST be placed above the `if (authLoading) return …` early-return line.** Chris has been bit by React error #310 *three times* across different Patch runs — every time, a new hook got dropped below the early return. When `authLoading` flips false on subsequent renders, more hooks run than the first render saw → React tears the tree down → ErrorBoundary fires → bad UX.

Rules for new code in App.jsx:
1. **All in-component hook calls go above `if (authLoading) return …`.** No exceptions. The handlers (functions returned by useCallback or plain `function foo()`) can live below; hooks themselves must not.
2. **When adding state for a feature, scan App.jsx first** to confirm you're adding it above the early return. Group new hooks with the existing `useState` block near the top.
3. **Before declaring a Patch done that touches App.jsx, grep for `useState\|useEffect\|useMemo\|useRef` line numbers and confirm none are below the `authLoading` return line.**

This rule applies to Patch agents AND to Claude. Adding a one-line comment marker above the early-return helps future passes notice:

```js
// ──── HOOKS ABOVE THIS LINE ────
if (authLoading) {
  return <PipLoader />;
}
```

If you ever need a hook that legitimately depends on post-auth data (e.g. it reads `userId`), pass `userId` as a dep and let the hook no-op when null. Never gate the hook itself behind an `if`.

## Documentation Discipline Rule (presentation docs stay in sync)

Folios ships with a presentation-ready documentation suite at `docs/`
(see `docs/README.md` for the index). These are the files Chris pulls
up when someone asks "got documentation?" — they're not internal notes,
they're the leave-behinds that go to VPs / IT / compliance reviewers.

**The rule:** every code change that affects a documented capability
triggers a `docs/*.md` update in the **same commit**. No drift.

Practical guide:
1. **Before shipping a feature**, scan `docs/` for any file that
   references the surface you're changing. Grep for the feature name,
   the table name, the user-facing label.
2. **If a doc mentions the thing you're changing**, update that doc in
   the same commit. Use the Edit tool — surgical changes only, don't
   rewrite whole files.
3. **If a doc claims a security/data property you're about to change**
   (e.g. "RLS-scoped per user"), update it BEFORE shipping the change.
   Never let docs lie about security posture even briefly.
4. **If a brand-new capability lands** with no existing doc home, add
   it to the right file (usually `product-overview.md` for features
   or `security.md` / `data-handling.md` for security-relevant ones).
5. **Update the `Last updated:` date** in the file's header on every
   edit. Readers use that to gauge freshness.

What NOT to do:
- Don't update docs for every micro-tweak. Bug fixes, styling polish,
  refactors that don't change capability — skip the doc update.
- Don't write marketing fluff. These docs are credibility artifacts;
  every claim must be true and verifiable.
- Don't duplicate facts across files. Each capability lives in ONE
  canonical place; other files reference it.

When in doubt: it's better to over-update than to let docs go stale.
A reader who finds stale docs loses trust in everything else in the
suite.

**PDF regeneration:** the docs suite generates styled PDFs into
`docs/pdf/` via `npm run docs:pdf` (script: `scripts/build-docs-pdf.js`,
stylesheet: `docs/pdf-style.css`, Pip-orb header in `docs/assets/pip-logo.svg`).
After any meaningful markdown edit in `docs/`, regenerate the PDFs in
the same commit so the committed PDFs never lag the markdown source.
The script handles all 9 docs at once (skips `README.md`); takes ~5s.

**Upgrade log discipline:** every major upgrade (new feature, schema
migration, architectural change — anything that meaningfully changes
what Folios *does* or *is*) gets a plain-English entry in
`docs/upgrades.md` in the same commit. Format: date + short heading +
What I built / Problem it solves / What changed / What you see today /
Why it matters. Written for Chris to read at a glance — no jargon, no
release-note formality. Bug fixes, styling tweaks, and doc-only
updates do NOT belong in upgrades.md — those live in git history.
Technical release-notes detail still goes in `changelog.md`.

## Patch — Background Build Agent

**Patch** is the name for the background agent used to execute large batch builds. When a batch of queued items is ready to ship, spawn Patch via the Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"` so it works in a clean copy of the repo without disrupting the main conversation.

- Patch handles the building, Claude handles the thinking
- Use Patch for multi-file batches (5+ files) to keep the main context clean
- Patch commits and pushes to `main` when done — one clean commit per batch
- The stop hook has a 10-minute grace period so Patch can work without triggering mid-batch commits
- **Default Patch to Sonnet, not Opus.** Pass `model: "sonnet"` when launching the Agent. Patch is execution-focused: the spec does the hard thinking, Sonnet just builds. ~4-5× cheaper per batch and noticeably faster than Opus, with no measurable quality regression on well-spec'd work. Reserve Opus-Patch for the rare build where mid-execution reasoning matters (e.g. an architecture refactor where Patch makes real judgment calls). Strategy + design + debugging conversations stay on Opus in the main session.

## Architecture

**Folios is the umbrella product** — a year-round account management app. Lanyard and Gauge are connected modules that live inside the Folios world, not separate apps with equal billing. The product name is **Folios** (plural); the GitHub repo is still named `Folio` (singular) for historical reasons — don't rename the repo.

- **Folios** (`chrisvasconcellos97/Folio`) — the main app. Year-round account management: accounts, meetings, cadences, contacts, open items, Pip AI. Production domain: `folioshq.com`. (Pipeline / revenue surfaces were intentionally ripped — see "Ripped (deliberate simplification)" below.)
- **Lanyard** (separate repo) — conference-specific module. Schedule, partner profiles, team chat, personal meeting notes, Pip AI. Punches out from Folios during conferences, feeds notes and partner data back.
- **Gauge** (lives under `gauge/` in this repo) — project management module. Tracks commitments and deliverables from account meetings (Phase 1), then expands to company-wide product team integration where PMs manage work and AMs are linked to relevant projects (Phase 2). Feeds project status back into Folios account views.

All three share the **same Supabase project**: `https://yrpdjmyfidhxlpmxasao.supabase.co`

### Gauge — Build Notes
- Phase 1: AM-facing. Commitments from meetings graduate into tracked projects in Gauge, visible on the account in Folios.
- Phase 2: Company-wide. Product team uses Gauge as their primary tool, AMs linked to relevant projects. Get input from OEC product team and PMs before building Phase 2 — they'll know what's missing.
- Same security model as Folios and Lanyard — shared Supabase, RLS, 2FA inherited automatically.

---

## Folios — Current State

- React + Vite, deployed on Vercel at `folioshq.com`, live as of May 2026
- Supabase Auth (real email/password accounts)
- Tables: `folio_accounts`, `folio_contacts`, `folio_meetings`, `folio_items` — all with RLS tied to `auth.uid()`. (Table names keep the `folio_` prefix — they're DB identifiers, not user-facing brand.)
- `folio_meetings` has two extra columns added post-launch: `pip_summary text`, `pip_email text`
- Pip AI proxy at `api/pip.js` using `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel env vars
- Schema is in `supabase/schema.sql` — run in production
- ABPA 2026 import is in `supabase/import_lanyard.sql` — run in production
- 11 accounts and 8 meetings imported from Lanyard with Pip summaries and draft emails attached

---

## Lanyard — Architecture Summary

- React + Vite, hosted on Vercel (separate deployment)
- **No real auth** — uses anonymous user IDs (`lanyard_uid`) generated and stored in `localStorage`
- Supabase accessed via raw REST fetch calls (no SDK), anon key hardcoded in `App.jsx`
- Single-file app: `src/App.jsx` (~4300 lines)

### Storage pattern
- **Writes to localStorage immediately** for speed, then debounces a Supabase upsert 1.5 seconds later
- **On load**: checks Supabase first, falls back to localStorage if nothing found

### Supabase tables (Lanyard)

| Table | user_id value | What's stored |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| `sessions` | `"abpa2026_team"` | Conference schedule events (shared) |
| `partners` | `"abpa2026_team"` | Partner/account profiles (shared) |
| `user_prefs` | `"u_<uid>"` | Hotel info, quick notes (personal) |
| `user_prefs` | `"u_<uid>_notes"` | Personal meeting notes per session (private) |
| `share_codes` | — | Temporary codes for syncing between teammates |
| `notifications` | — | Team activity feed (built, SQL not yet run) |
| `messages` | — | Team chat, DMs, shoutouts (built, SQL not yet run) |

### The auth problem
`lanyard_uid` lives in localStorage — clearing the browser or switching devices loses personal notes. Shared data (under `"abpa2026_team"`) is safe. **Adding real Supabase Auth to Lanyard is the top priority for the next Lanyard build.**

---

## Folios ↔ Lanyard Integration — Current Status

- Lanyard ABPA 2026 partner data and meeting notes have been imported into Folios
- Going forward, Lanyard will need real auth before bidirectional sync makes sense

---

## Pip

Both Folios and Lanyard use the same Pip personality — a loyal, slightly anxious field analyst. Pip has access to account/meeting context injected into the system prompt. Model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

### Pip cost strategy
- Generate Pip outputs once, save to DB (`pip_summary`, `pip_email` columns)
- Never regenerate what's already saved — load from DB instead
- Future "Ask Pip" button should check for existing output before making an API call

---

## Supabase

- Project URL: `https://yrpdjmyfidhxlpmxasao.supabase.co`
- Same project for Folios and Lanyard
- Folios tables have proper RLS via `auth.uid()`
- Lanyard tables use text `user_id` fields (not auth UUIDs)

---

## Scalability Notes

This app is currently single-user but should be built with multi-tenancy in mind from the start. Every decision should assume it will eventually serve multiple businesses with multiple users per business.

- **RLS is already user-scoped** — good foundation, but team/org layer will be needed
- **Future: add `org_id` to all tables** — one org per business, users belong to orgs, RLS updates to match
- **Pip at scale** — Haiku is cheap but at volume, saved outputs (never re-call for same meeting) are essential
- **Avoid hardcoding user IDs** — `import_lanyard.sql` has a hardcoded user ID for one-time import only, never repeat this pattern in app code
- **Keep hooks thin** — data logic lives in `/hooks`, components stay presentational
- **Schema changes** — always add columns with `if not exists`, never destructive migrations

---

## Development Workflow

- Features requested by Chris go on **Pending Updates** list below
- Chris says "ship it" → everything on the list gets built in one batch
- Items drop off the list after they ship
- If items should be grouped for efficiency, suggest it before executing
- Never execute immediately on a feature request — queue it first
- **Before shipping items 4–7:** do a full layout audit first — review placement, spacing, and information hierarchy across every screen to make sure new features land cleanly into a well-organized foundation

### Idea Capture Rule (read this every session)

**Nothing Chris mentions gets discarded.** Ideas have been lost across chats — this is the fix.

- **Capture aggressively, not selectively.** If Chris says "could we also...", "what about...", "I'd love...", "I'm wondering if...", "would be nice to have...", or even floats a half-formed idea mid-conversation → it goes into **Pending Updates** or **Feature Wishlist / Roadmap** *that same turn*, before responding to anything else.
- **Even rejected/deferred ideas get logged** in the Wishlist with a one-line note on why deferred — so they resurface if context changes.
- **Asides count.** "Side note, the Departments thing would be cool" → that's an idea, capture it.
- **Tangents in the middle of another feature discussion count.** If Chris is walking through Cadence Hub and mentions a Departments tab → capture Departments immediately, don't lose it in the Cadence Hub conversation.
- **When in doubt, log it.** A half-captured idea is recoverable. A forgotten idea is gone.
- **Confirm capture out loud** when you log something new mid-conversation: "Queued under [section]." So Chris sees it landed.

18. **Internal / people cadences + 1:1 mode** — Phases 1 + 2 shipped — see Already shipped. Remaining Phase 3: post-meeting Pip action item routing to specific accounts (already built in PipSummarizePreview cross-account routing, just needs wiring for the person-cadence context). Leadership tasks (items with cadence_id + null account_id) persisted as a dedicated "leadership task" type — deferred until usage patterns emerge.

19. **Pip portfolio intelligence upgrade (chief of staff mode)** — Pip gains cross-portfolio awareness so it can reason about work state across all accounts simultaneously. Four tiers of increasing sophistication — build Tier A first since it's the foundation everything else runs on.

    **Tier A — Account state snapshots + daily brief (build first, ~80% from existing data)**
    - **`folio_account_snapshots` table** — one row per account per day, computed nightly: health score, days since last contact, open item count, overdue count, active Gauge project count, stuck project count. Zero LLM cost; pure DB derivation. This is the foundation for everything in Tiers B–D.
    - **Portfolio work state** — All active Gauge projects + completion state + stuck detection passed to Pip in a compressed format. Powers "4 audits in flight, here's where each stands" synthesis.
    - **Daily brief** — One Haiku call per day (cached), cross-portfolio morning summary: what's due, what's at risk, what needs your attention. Estimated cost: ~$0.07/month.
    - **Win surfacing** — Recently delivered/closed work surfaced automatically for 1:1s and QBRs. Easy to forget wins when heads-down.
    - **Momentum scoring** — Health trend over time from snapshots, not just current state. "Parts Authority was at-risk, now recovering" vs "All Star drifting despite healthy score."

    **Tier B — People modeling + commitment tracking (requires new light-weight data structures)**
    - **Contact engagement history** — Log last contacted date per contact, response speed inferred from meeting frequency. "Sarah responds within 48h" vs "Mike goes quiet before renewals." Stored in `folio_contacts` or a thin engagement log table.
    - **Client-side commitment ledger** — What you promised to deliver to whom and when, pulled from Gauge projects + meeting notes. Flags at-risk commitments before they miss. Requires extracting commitments from meeting notes via a lightweight Haiku pass at summarize time, stored as structured rows.
    - **Relationship temperature from tone** — `pip_tone` already written on every summarize. Trend it over time per account: consistently positive → stable; recently cooling → flag. No extra LLM calls needed, just reading the existing field over snapshots.

    **Tier C — Pattern detection + anomaly detection (most powerful, highest leverage)**
    - **Cross-account pattern recognition** — When the same theme surfaces across 3+ accounts (e.g. "pricing concern", "integration delay"), Pip flags it as a portfolio signal worth raising to leadership. Requires meeting theme extraction (one tag per meeting via Haiku at summarize time).
    - **Anomaly detection vs own baseline** — "This account is 3× more active than your usual cadence for its tier" or "No meeting in 45 days, typically you meet every 3 weeks." Personal baseline, not industry benchmark.
    - **Capacity triage reasoning** — Pip knows your current load (open projects, cadences this week, QBRs due) so it can factor in bandwidth when briefing your boss or making suggestions. Built on Tier A snapshot data.

    **Tier D — Proactive outputs (build last, requires Tiers A–C as foundation)**
    - **Proactive standing agendas** — Before any meeting, Pip suggests talking points based on unresolved items, time elapsed, outstanding commitments, and relationship temperature. Not just for 1:1s.
    - **Draft-ahead offers** — Pip drafts a follow-up email, a status update, or a QBR slide outline *before* you ask. Triggered by: meeting completed with no follow-up logged in 48h, project milestone hit, account health drop.
    - **Boss-ready rollup** — Pip generates a 30-second spoken summary of portfolio state, formatted for your weekly 1:1 with your manager. What's strong, what needs attention, what you're asking for.

    **Data Pip needs that it's not getting today:**
    - *Feed today:* detailed meeting notes (already there), attendees (already there), account updates (already there), Gauge for all commitments (already there), contacts with roles (already there)
    - *New structures needed:* `folio_account_snapshots` (daily computed, Tier A foundation); contact engagement log (last contacted per person, thin); meeting theme tags (one tag extracted at summarize time, stored on `folio_meetings`); commitment rows extracted from notes (structured `folio_commitments` table or piggyback onto `folio_items` with a `commitment_type` flag)

    **Cost analysis:** Tier A (daily brief) ≈ $0.07/month. Tiers B–C add marginal cost only at summarize time (one extra tag extraction). Tier D adds one Haiku call per triggered draft. Total at full build: ~$0.50–1.00/month. The expensive path (querying Pip on every page load) is explicitly avoided — all intelligence is computed once, cached, and read cheaply.

20. **Pip memory transparency panel** — Per-account view of everything Pip has learned so far. Shows: corrections history (what you've edited, rejected, or added), `lessons_learned` from compressed correction log, contact classifications (who responds fast, who goes quiet before renewals), tone trend over last N meetings, pattern matches flagged across accounts. Goal: Chris can see exactly what Pip "knows" about each account and correct it if something is wrong. Lives as a collapsible panel or a "What Pip knows" button in the account detail header or CadenceHub sidebar. Reads from `pip_correction_log`, `pip_account_state.lessons_learned`, `folio_contacts`, and (once built) `folio_account_snapshots`.

**Already shipped (drop from list):**
- ✅ **Internal / people cadences + 1:1 mode** — Phase 1 (My Department flag + Pip context injection) shipped above. Phase 2 now shipped: `folio_cadences.account_id` made nullable; `contact_id` + `cadence_scope` ('account'|'person') columns added. SetCadenceModal gets "Account / Person 1:1" scope toggle + contact picker. AccountDetail on My Department accounts shows "Leadership 1:1s" section with per-contact cadence cards and "+ Add 1:1" button. CadenceHub: null-safety audit throughout; person cadences show portfolio brief (from Tier A daily brief infrastructure) instead of account brief. CadenceMeetingMode: null-safety audit + contact name fallback in headers. CadenceView/ListView/CalendarView/WeekView: person cadences display "PERSON 1:1" badge + contact name. App.jsx: `pendingPersonHubCadenceId` state threads deep-link from CadenceView into AccountDetail. SQL: `supabase/folio_1on1_cadences.sql` — run in production.
- ✅ **Gauge template total turnaround time** — `total_duration_days` on templates + `expected_complete_date` on projects. "Est. Xd" chip when browsing templates. Creating from template sets expected complete date = today + duration. Project cards show expected date, goes amber when past. SQL: `supabase/gauge_template_duration.sql` — run in production.
- ✅ **Pip memory transparency panel** — "✦ What Pip knows" button on every account header. Opens modal showing: lessons learned (compressed from correction history), recent corrections grouped by type (summary edits, rejected rows, missed items, text corrections, routing fixes), pip_tone chip, total correction count. Read-only, no schema changes.
- ✅ **Pip portfolio intelligence — Tier A (account state snapshots + daily brief)** — `folio_account_snapshots` table (one row per account per day: health status/score, days since contact, open/overdue item counts, active/stuck project counts, pip_tone). `computeAndSaveSnapshots()` runs client-side on app load once per calendar day, fire-and-forget, uses `gatherSignals + computeAccountHealth` for consistency with AccountsView. `useAccountSnapshots` hook reads today's rows. `/api/portfolio-brief` Haiku endpoint returns a 3-5 sentence cross-portfolio morning brief from compressed portfolio data. `callPortfolioBriefPip()` helper in pip.js. HomeView: "Pip · Daily Brief" card at top, generated once/day, cached in localStorage. `buildPortfolioState()` in pipContext.js for use in 1:1 mode and leader brief. SQL: `supabase/folio_account_snapshots.sql` — **run in production Supabase**.
- ✅ **My Department flag** — `is_my_department` boolean on `folio_accounts` with partial unique index (one per user). Department card gets "MY TEAM" badge + teal left border. Toggle in AddAccountModal when creating/editing a department. Pip context includes "MY TEAM: [name]" so Pip knows which team is the user's own.
- ✅ **Business Review mode** — per-account QBR generator. Date range picker + Pip synthesizes Account Connections, OEC Opportunities, and Client Opportunities sections from meetings/contacts/projects/items in range. Static Sales Metrics placeholder for user to fill from corporate systems. Copy per section + "Copy all for Claude" button for pasting into work Claude alongside revenue numbers. Lives in account detail header next to Brief Me.
- ✅ **In-app notification banner** — covered by `HomeView`, which is the entry point after login. Surfaces overdue items (count + Glow clickable), cold accounts (>45d, sorted longest-cold first), and today's cadences in a Pip narrative. Richer and more interactive than a static banner; no separate banner needed.
- ✅ **Add Contact from Meeting Hub + contact search match indicator** — `CadenceMeetingMode` sidebar Contacts section now has a `+` button that expands an inline quick-add form (name required, role + email optional). On save the contact is written to `folio_contacts` on the meeting's account and auto-checked as attending. Wired through CadenceHub ← AccountDetail and AdHocConversationFlow; mobile contacts tab gets the same form. `accountIdsWithContactMatch` in AccountsView upgraded from bare boolean to `{ name, title }` — when an account card surfaces because a contact matched (not the account name), a `CONTACT: Jane Doe · VP Sales` line appears under the account name explaining the match.
- ✅ **Ask Pip on meetings** — "Ask Pip" button on each meeting card calls the Pip API to generate a prose summary + draft follow-up email, saved to `pip_summary` / `pip_email` on `folio_meetings`. Cost-floor guard: if `pip_summary` already exists the API call is skipped entirely and the cached output is displayed. Button disappears once summarized; outputs render with a `mailto:` link and copy button.
- ✅ **Gauge V3 — three views + unified task model (all 6 phases)** — Phase 1: new `folio_tasks` table replacing `folio_items` + `gauge_projects.stages`; Pip plan-apply dual-writes both stores during transition. Phase 2: `default_lens text` column on `folio_org_members` ('am' | 'leader' | 'admin') with invite-time dropdown + smart pre-fill, existing owners backfilled to leader; Pip's system prompt branches per lens (AM = your accounts, Admin = your queue, Leader = team-wide). Phase 3: `FlatTaskQueue` flat task view + Projects/Tasks toggle (Admin lens lands on Tasks); one-time backfill SQL explodes folio_items + gauge_projects.stages into folio_tasks rows. Phase 4: discrete project templates now carry `assignee_email` + `due_offset_days` per stage and sub-stage; "Save as template" preserves both; "+ From Template" hydrates due dates from offsets relative to today. Phase 5: `LeaderProjectsView` org-wide rollup (AM/account/status/stuck filters, progress bars, "STUCK · Nd" pill when no stage completed 7d+, expandable stages-inline rows) + `TeammateDetailView` read-only drill-in via AM chip (their open tasks + project stages + projects + accounts); lens-aware default lands Leader on Leader view; 3-way Leader/Projects/Tasks toggle. Phase 6: V2-brain corrections wiring threaded through `ProjectStageEditor` + `StandingBoardView` + `MyQueueView` → `TaskDetailPanel`; post-apply account override on TaskDetailPanel fires `routed_account_changed` correction; AM "Projects I own" rollup on Gauge home shows the AM's active projects across owned accounts with progress bars + click-to-expand; org-wide assignment hints — once ≥ 3 distinct account-specific hints share the same `task_pattern` + `assignee_email`, `addHint` inserts an `account_id=null` cross-account hint so Pip auto-routes that work everywhere. PipGaugeCard sidebar (Pip narrative + Due ≤7d / Stuck 7d+ / Shipped 7d counters + Up Next · 14d + Watchlist + No-movement + Recent activity + Team load) replaces the thin one-liner on desktop; layout centers at 1100px max-width for ultrawide / split-screen. SQL: `supabase/gauge_v3_folio_tasks.sql` + `gauge_v3_default_lens.sql` + `gauge_v3_backfill_tasks.sql` all run in production.
- ✅ **Pip V2 brain — correction log + read-back + compression + missed_item + routed_account_changed** — `pip_correction_log` table (`correction_type`: summary_edit | rejected_row | item_text_edit | task_text_edit | missed_item | routed_account_changed) with RLS scoped to auth.uid(). `usePipCorrections` hook + `logCorrection(payload)` helper. Capture surfaces: MeetingsTab summary edits (on-blur diff against last-saved Pip output), PipSummarizePreview row rejections + manually-added missed items, TaskDetailPanel + ProjectStageEditor + StandingBoardView + MyQueueView item-text edits (guarded by `pip_created_at` age — only counts within 7 days of Pip creation), account-override moves. Read-back: last 10 corrections per account injected into every `summarizeDraftPip` system prompt (capped ~1000 tokens, oldest trimmed). Compression: Haiku pass every ~5 meetings compacts the log into `pip_account_state.lessons_learned`; rows older than 60 days archived. Pip Brief footer surfaces a one-liner "Pip remembers: …" when relevant lessons exist. SQL: `supabase/pip_correction_log.sql` + canonical `schema.sql`.
- ✅ **Pip's plan modal — five-fix polish pass + "Add an item Pip missed"** — (1) 22px custom checkboxes with clear empty / checked / hover states. (2) Inline-editable row titles (new_item / new_task title; update_item proposed text). (3) "see source" expander per row showing the editable `source_excerpt` Pip used to derive the row — edits feed the rejection learning loop. (4) Side-by-side diff for update rows — full current text struck-through above proposed text, expand-in-full affordance. (5) Cancel confirmation interstitial when changes are present ("Discard Pip's plan? Notes are saved"); auto-skip when no edits made. Plus a "+ Add an item Pip missed" affordance that writes a `missed_item` correction so Pip learns what it's leaving out. Pip's prompt updated to return `source_excerpt` per row.
- ✅ **Pip knowledge-base (Push 1 + Push 2)** — Push 1: full account context plumbs through Pip's system prompt (recent meeting history, open items + tasks, contacts with roles, recent updates, active Gauge projects). New Glossary v1 lets users register custom terms per account/org so Pip uses the company's vocabulary instead of generic phrasing. Push 2: cross-account routing — Pip's plan can return `target_account_id` to route a task off the current account onto its true home. Internal-meeting prior — Pip recognizes internal-team meetings (`account_type=internal_team`) and shifts summary tone away from customer-facing language.
- ✅ **Pip cost optimizations (cumulative pass)** — prompt caching on every Pip endpoint (system prompt cached so per-call cost ≈ output tokens only). `pip_account_state.lessons_learned` compressed into a stable paragraph so read-back context stays small as the correction log grows. Trivial-draft skip — no Pip API call if the draft is empty or below threshold; summarize short-circuits with a local placeholder. Output token budget on summarize bumped 3× with truncation detection (if hit, the system asks for a re-summarize at higher budget).
- ✅ **Calendar — unified daily/weekly/monthly view + smarter meeting titles** — Calendar replaces the standalone Meetings view as the home for "what's happening." Daily, weekly, and monthly modes share one component. Pip generates short, email-subject-style titles per meeting so calendar entries read at a glance ("ACME Q3 cadence — invoice feed follow-up" instead of "ACME · May 28"). Account pill on every entry. Pip narrative card at the top frames the upcoming day/week ("3 cadences today, 1 follow-up overdue").
- ✅ **Home page rebuild + Quick email log + Auto-bullet notes** — `HomeView` is the new app entrypoint after sign-in: Pip narrative panels with embedded Glow clickables that route to the right surface (overdue items, cold accounts, today's cadences). Deprecates `ReturningWelcome` — HomeView does that job better and stays adaptive. Quick email log: one-shot 10-second log (contact picker + Pip action-item review), replaces the bigger overlay flow for simple "I just emailed X" captures. Auto-bullet notes: cadence meeting + quick capture textareas preserve pasted bullets and normalize markers to "• ".
- ✅ **Pip visual upgrades — state-driven mood** — `PipStateProvider` context drives orb state (idle / thinking / speaking / alert) via CSS class on `.pip`. Breathing keyframe when idle, mouth-shape pulse when speaking, alert pulse when surfacing an urgent insight. Reduced-motion gating respects user preference. Mobile floating Pip hidden on home view (centerpiece orb already there). Bottom nav tabs equal-weight (2px top-border for active state instead of pill container).
- ✅ **Stale-chunk auto-recovery + Diagnostics Copy-all** — `window.addEventListener('error', …)` pattern-matches dynamic-import failures (typically a stale build's hashed chunk no longer on the CDN) and triggers a hard reload to fetch the new bundle. Diagnostics rows in `ObservabilityView` gain a "Copy all" button on expand — full error context (stack, breadcrumbs, environment) goes to clipboard in one click.
- ✅ **Presentation-ready docs suite + PDF pipeline + upgrade log** — `docs/` directory: product-overview / architecture / security / data-handling / ai-governance / reliability / roadmap / changelog / upgrades + README index. `npm run docs:pdf` (script: `scripts/build-docs-pdf.js`) generates styled PDFs into `docs/pdf/` via md-to-pdf + Puppeteer (`--no-sandbox` for container env), Pip-branded header (inline SVG orb at canonical proportions), Letter page size, page-numbered footer. `docs/upgrades.md` — plain-English log of major upgrades for non-technical readers. Discipline rules added to CLAUDE.md: Documentation Discipline (docs update same commit as capability change), PDF regeneration after markdown edits, Upgrade log entries for every major upgrade.
- ✅ **React #310 fix + Modal focus-stealing fix + suggested-task wrap** — `pillWorkspaceType` hooks hoisted above the `authLoading` early-return in App.jsx (no more hook-count mismatch on second render). Modal's focus-trap effect deps simplified so it doesn't re-fire on every parent re-render and steal focus mid-typing. Suggested-task chips wrap on mobile instead of clipping past viewport edge. React Hook Order Rule added to CLAUDE.md to prevent a future regression.
- ✅ **Gauge project drafts** — X-closing a new `ProjectModal` with content prompts "Save as draft?" (in-modal interstitial with Save / Discard / Keep editing). Draft saved via `status: "draft"` on `gauge_projects` (check constraint updated in `supabase/gauge_project_drafts.sql` and canonical `schema.sql`). Draft cards float to top of the project list, render at 0.65 opacity with a yellow `DRAFT` pill and yellow border tint. Clicking a draft card opens `ProjectModal` in "Draft Project" edit mode; the Save button says "Publish Project" and promotes status to `"planned"`. `statusDraft` token added to `colors.js` + both theme palettes in `index.html`.
- ✅ **AccountsView v2 — Pip-computed health + override modal** — `src/lib/accountHealth.js` with pure `computeAccountHealth` + `gatherSignals` (tier-aware thresholds: Major/Mid/Growth, override with expiry path, 'new' status for accounts < 7 days old). `AccountHealthOverrideModal` for pinning Watching/At Risk with reason + optional expiry date. AccountsView: removed StatusBanner, QuickActionBar, stats grid, new-user checklist; added workspaces segmented pill (shows only when departments or partners exist); card left-edge border driven by computed health; micro health caption per card (e.g., "3 OVERDUE", "45D COLD"). AccountDetailHeader: computed health pill + reason text + 📌 badge + click-to-override. AddAccountModal: status field removed (health is computed, not set manually). Silent enrichments: `pip_tone` field added to `summarizeDraftPip` response and written on summarize in all three call sites; `pip_promise_log` ledger written fire-and-forget on `closeItem`; periodic `pip_account_state` refresh (top 10 recently-active, throttled 6h) in App.jsx; `renderAccountFull` in pipContext emits status override line when set. Desktop nav: Departments + Partners entries removed (navigation via workspaces pill). SQL: `supabase/account_health.sql` + canonical `schema.sql` updated with override columns, `pip_tone`, and `pip_promise_log` table.
- ✅ **Mobile responsiveness pass** — standardized every ad-hoc viewport check on `useBreakpoint()` (900px). AccountsView stats grid stacks to 2 cols on mobile, search row's filter buttons drop below the input, page header uses size-32 Mark + 26px title. AccountDetailHeader title drops to 26px, right-side revenue/cadence/buttons column moves below the title block, pill row gains `overflow:hidden` + scoped 9px/`2px 7px` sizing via `.acc-hdr-pills`. StartConversationModal method picker collapses to single column. CadenceMeetingMode now starts collapsed below desktop breakpoint, sidebar width caps to viewport-friendly 320px when expanded on mobile, vitals strip flattens to a single one-liner, top-bar Summarize button shrinks to "Summarize ✦", notepad padding tightens to 14/16. GaugeView stats grid stacks to 2 cols on mobile, header stacks vertically and uses size-32 Mark. StandingBoardView kanban stacks to single-column (no horizontal scroll). MyQueueView project-title button truncates with ellipsis. MobileLayout "+ Account" button tightens to 10px/5×10. Modal already capped maxWidth to viewport − 16px and padded 8px on mobile — left intact.
- ✅ **Unified Log Conversation flow** — Ad-hoc conversations now use the same full-screen `CadenceMeetingMode` as cadence meetings. New `StartConversationModal` (searchable account picker when global, required method + date) drops a draft meeting with `cadence_id=null` and hands off to the meeting overlay. `CadenceMeetingMode` gracefully handles a null cadence (method label in top bar, Pip-brief panel skipped) and the sidebar Contacts list is now a multi-select that debounces into `folio_meetings.attendees`. End & Summarize routes through the same `PipSummarizePreview` plan flow. Ad-hoc meetings land in History with the `AD-HOC` pill via the existing `cadence_id` check. New `AdHocConversationFlow` wrapper hosts the overlay when launched from the global "+ Conversation" pill so account-scoped hooks load once. Deprecates and deletes `QuickMeetingModal` + `LogConversationModal`; QuickActionBar's inline meeting mini-form removed in favor of the unified modal.
- ✅ **Revenue-impact Update Calendar v1** — `folio_account_updates` table (SQL in `supabase/account_updates.sql`, mirrored into canonical `schema.sql`) keyed on `account_id` with `update_date`, `update_type` (catalog / pricing / integration / product_launch / training / promo / external_event / other), `title`, `description`, `owner` (free text + member typeahead), `observed_impact`, optional `gauge_project_id`. `useAccountUpdates` hook + realtime sync. New "Updates" tab on AccountDetail with its own animated `updates` Mark glyph (timeline ticks + breathing event flag, 6.2s cycle) registered in `Mark.jsx`. `AddUpdateModal` with hybrid owner input. "Recent updates" tile on Overview (last 5, links into the full tab). Revenue sparkline gets thin colored ticks per `UPDATE_TYPE_COLORS` at each `update_date`; hover tooltip shows title + owner + date. Pip context grows a `recentUpdates` block per account (top 6) so revenue-dip questions can cross-reference what changed. Manual entry only in v1 — supplier-side / customer-internal blind spots remain; v3 (auto-ingestion webhook) deferred.
- ✅ **Folios design system refresh** — unified `Mark` component (10 tab marks + Pip brand) in `src/components/Mark.jsx` with shared rAF engine: page-size marks (>=52) animate per the README spec (accounts dossiers drift, departments cycle, partners breathe, meetings seats sequence, pipeline bars rise, cadence dot orbits, gauge needle sweeps, team triad pulses, route tracer travels, settings knobs glide); rail (22) + compact (32) stay static. Loop self-starts on first registration and stops when idle. Reduced-motion gating disables both rAF registration AND the CSS glow keyframe. Rail marks pick up `active` prop → 2.8s `fol-mark-active` pulse. `LitPill` component (Mist fill + teal border + glow + pulsing teal pip dot) — desktop rail "+ Account/Department/Partner" footer CTA migrated. L-connector for nested child accounts (`.acct-child::before` draws teal L with double drop-shadow). Sidebar Mist background in light mode via new `--c-rail-bg` token (desktop rail + mobile header + bottom nav). Stat-tile tier-tinted halos (`stat-tile-watching` ochre, `stat-tile-risk` terracotta) light-only. `rgba(255,255,255,0.04)` overlays across 5 modals tokenized via `--c-input-fill`. `rgba(0,0,0,0.X)` shadows in Toast / Modal / CommandPalette / UserMenu tokenized via `--c-overlay-shadow*`. NavMark kept as a thin alias to Mark for diagnostics + back-compat.
- ✅ **Cadence meeting reminders (Pip pre-call nudges)** — `useCadenceReminders` hook ticks every 30s, computes each cadence's next occurrence via `getNextOccurrence` + `meeting_time`, fires three thresholds (30m / 5m / start) as in-app `MeetingReminderBanner` rows at the top of the app. Fired + dismissed sets persist in localStorage (`folio_cadence_reminders_fired` / `folio_cadence_reminders_dismissed`) so a refresh never replays. Browser `Notification` API fires system pop-ups when permission granted. One-time discreet "Want Pip to ping you?" prompt surfaces the first time a cadence with a `meeting_time` exists. Settings → Cadence Reminders section adds a browser-notifications request + in-app banners toggle. Start-tone banner CTA threads `autoOpenMeetingMode` through AccountDetail → CadenceHub, which programmatically clicks Start Meeting on mount (auto-creating today's draft and opening `CadenceMeetingMode`). Skips cadences without `meeting_time`, inactive accounts, and stale reminders (>6h past start).
- ✅ **Smarter Pip summarize + preview modal** — `summarizeDraftPip` now receives existing open items + in-flight Gauge tasks + org members + learned assignment hints, and returns a structured `plan[]` (new_item / update_item / close_item / new_task / update_task / skip) instead of a flat action-item list. The new `PipSummarizePreview` modal renders the plan with checkboxes + assignee dropdowns + due-date inputs, grouped into Changes / New / Skipped, with yellow dots on low-confidence rows. Apply runs the selected rows through `addItem` / `updateItem` / `closeItem` / `updateProject` (project stages batched per project for one round-trip). Assignee overrides are persisted into `pip_assignment_hints` (`account_id`, normalized `task_pattern`, `assignee_email`) via `usePipAssignmentHints`, fed back into Pip's next summarize. Wired into both DraftCard (Cadence Hub) and CadenceMeetingMode (full-screen). Cancel preserves the summarized meeting but applies nothing. Falls back gracefully to synthesized new_item rows if Pip returns the legacy flat shape. SQL: `supabase/pip_assignment_hints.sql` (run manually) + canonical `schema.sql`.
- ✅ **Multi-phase hardening pass (8 phases)** — Security (RLS holes patched, Pip prompt-injection guards, autosave/signout wipes, rate limits). Reliability (fetch timeouts, autosave-failure toasts + localStorage backup, top-level + view-level ErrorBanner Retry, double-click guards, `src/lib/net.js` with retry/timeout/timed). Pip cost (folio_pip_usage table + RLS, prompt caching on ask-pip & pip-state-refresh, Sonnet→Haiku downgrade for brief/summary/email, MeetingsTab + CadenceHub short-circuits, Pip Usage tile + details modal in Settings). Code quality (AccountDetail -42%, OverviewTab -29%, useBreakpoint extracted, accountInsights.jsx extracted, 24 new tests). Data integrity + export (19 hot-path indexes, gauge_projects cascade flipped to set null, canonical schema.sql sync, per-account JSON export). Observability (folio_errors table + RLS, ErrorBoundary at App + per-Suspense, window.onerror + unhandledrejection, Diagnostics nav with badge, ObservabilityView, `timed()` helper). Accessibility (skip-to-content, aria-live on Toast + StatusBanner, ARIA combobox/listbox on CommandPalette, account-card aria-label with tier/status, WCAG AA contrast bumps for light-mode `--text-mute`/red/blue, global `prefers-reduced-motion`, `:focus-visible` outline, `pointer: coarse` 44×44 tap targets, tier label in compact mode). Multi-device realtime sync (Supabase Realtime subscriptions on every data hook, ~500ms debounced refetch on change, ConnectionStatus indicator only on drop, visibility-change reconnect).
- ✅ **Inactive / Archive + Account Merge** — `is_inactive`, `inactivated_at`, `merged_into_account_id` on `folio_accounts`; `is_inactive`, `inactivated_at` on `folio_org_members`. Postgres `folio_merge_accounts(source, target)` re-parents every child row atomically. Hide-inactive toggle per workspace, INACTIVE/MERGED pills, Reactivate + Merge-into UI. Inactive users blocked from sign-in. Pip insight + StatusBanner exclude inactive from rollups.
- ✅ **Light theme + Settings toggle** — token swap via CSS custom properties on `[data-theme]`, pre-mount inline script prevents flash, `useTheme` hook persists to localStorage. Tier-colored halos on light account cards, paper Pip-card. Both themes inherit the same component grammar.
- ✅ **Cadence Hub V2 — prep dashboard + full-screen meeting mode** — Hub became a pre-call command center: Pip brief, big "Start Meeting" CTA, inline-expanding Gauge project cards (StandingBoardView/ProjectStageEditor inside), open items, follow-ups, history widened to ALL meetings on the account with `CADENCE`/`AD-HOC` tags. Start Meeting auto-creates a draft (`"{Cadence label} — {date}"`), reuses today's draft if one exists, then opens `CadenceMeetingMode` — a portal-based full-screen overlay that covers the global chrome with a top bar (close + End & Summarize), a collapsible left sidebar (Pip brief / projects / open items / contacts), a viewport-filling notes textarea, and a quick action-item add. Autosaves every 1.5s, ESC closes, "End & Summarize" runs the existing Pip flow.
- ✅ **Cadence Hub** — per-cadence all-access workspace. Active drafts, summarize-with-Pip flow (writes action items into folio_items), meeting history, open items + follow-ups. Mobile 4-tab segmented control. Backfill banner inside hub.
- ✅ **Workspaces (Departments + Partners)** — `account_type` extended; AccountsView reused with `typeFilter`. Desktop 3-flat-item nav with divider; mobile collapsible Workspaces group. Conditional UI per type (no revenue/pipeline on Dept/Partner; partner-only agreement-end/scope/billing/spend fields). Pip context branches per type.
- ✅ **Account owners** — `owner_user_id` on `folio_accounts`. Owner picker in AddAccountModal (when org > 1). Header initials chip + reassign dropdown. "Mine" filter chip in workspace lists.
- ✅ **Activity audit trail** — Settings → Activity section. Owner sees org-wide feed, non-owner sees own actions. Filters: time range / account / event type / user (owner-only). Pagination via `useActivity` hook reading `folio_activity` (already populated by every write hook).
- ✅ **Pip card / nav / page conventions** — NavMark component with per-section SVG marks (folders/grid/circles/pawn/bars/speedometer/orb/triangle/route/exclamation). Each main page header shows its mark next to the Fraunces title. Glow component for inline clickable highlights inside Pip prose (used by StatusBanner + every PipInsightCard). ErrorBanner for hook-error retry. AddToTasksButton for action-item → task promotion.
- ✅ **Demo data seed script** — `scripts/seed-demo-data.js` populates a Supabase Auth user with ~50 accounts (mixed tiers/types, ~4 inactive), ~150 contacts, ~400 meetings, ~300 items, ~25 cadences, ~20 Gauge projects, 25 quick tasks. Idempotent (wipes prior demo data first). Requires `DEMO_USER_EMAIL` / `DEMO_USER_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
- ✅ Data Visualization — 8-point sparklines + MoM trend arrows on account cards (later ripped — see "Ripped" section); 6-month meeting frequency bars on account detail header (KEPT)
- ✅ Gauge + Account Change Log — deliveries in Brief Me, active projects fed into Pip context, Recent Deliveries on Overview (already shipped)
- 🪓 **Route Builder (ripped)** — TSP optimizer, Nominatim geocoding, schedule sidebar, Google Maps handoff. Removed — not used in practice. Nav item gone, `src/views/routes/` deleted, lazy import removed from App.jsx. DB columns intact if needed later.
- ✅ Team/Org Layer + Leadership View — `folio_orgs`, `folio_org_members`, `folio_account_notes`, `folio_activity` tables + migration SQL (`supabase/team_org_layer.sql`). `useOrg` hook, `useAccountNotes` hook (migrates from `account.objective`), fire-and-forget `logActivity` in all write hooks. Settings view with create-team + invite/revoke UI. Leadership view (full-width read-only portfolio dashboard). Invite banner on login. Role-aware rendering: leadership gets LeadershipView; everyone else gets normal app. "Team" nav item on desktop sidebar. "Settings" in UserMenu (mobile).
- ✅ **Gauge — Standing Projects + Custom Columns + Admin Queue** — `is_standing`, `custom_field_schema`, `task_status_columns` columns on `gauge_projects` (migration in `supabase/gauge_standing_projects.sql`). Per-task `custom_fields`, `account_id`, `task_status`, `created_at` inside the existing `stages` jsonb array. `src/lib/gaugeFields.js` defines field types (text/longtext/number/date/dropdown/person/checkbox/url) and seeds "bones" defaults (Priority, Owner, Submission Date, Due Date, Description, Related Link). `ProjectModal` now has a Discrete/Standing mode toggle + inline `CustomFieldSchemaEditor` for managing columns. Unified `TaskDetailPanel` handles both new-task and edit-from-queue flows with every custom field rendered by type. `StandingBoardView` renders the kanban (one column per `task_status_columns` id) inside the expanded project row. `MyQueueView` flattens tasks across all projects assigned to the current user with Live / Planning / All sub-filters and an optional group-by-project toggle. Project status bubbles into task display via `PLANNING` / `ON HOLD` chips on planned/on_hold projects. "Stages" renamed to "Tasks" everywhere user-facing; DB column name stays `stages` for backwards compat.
- ✅ Gauge V2 — stages, requested_by, assignee multi-user RLS, My Queue filter, New Request from Folios, status values fixed (planned/in_progress/blocked/complete/on_hold)
- ✅ Quick Tasks — tray on main page, modal with account dropdown + reminder presets, Pip integration (surface open tasks on load, complete/add via natural language)
- ✅ Sub-accounts — UI + migration (`parent_account_id` column live), nested display with faded ↳ arrow on accounts list
- ✅ Pip Summarize with date range (30d / 90d / all time presets, saves to account)

- ✅ Last interaction tracking (`last_interaction_at` drives days counter on account cards)
- ✅ MSO prep — `account_type`, `address`, `lat`, `lng`, `account_number` columns live on `folio_accounts`. Account type toggle in AddAccountModal. MSO accounts get a Shops tab showing child shops with address, status, last-visit. Shop count chip on MSO cards. Address and account number display in account detail header.

- ✅ CadenceView file split — CalendarView, WeekView, ListView, cadenceShared extracted; CadenceView.jsx down to ~200 lines
- ✅ Persistent filter prefs — filter state persisted to localStorage in AccountsView
- ✅ Empty state copy — "Nothing here yet — add your first account and I'll get to work"
- ✅ Error message copy — "Couldn't delete/save — check your connection" across MeetingsTab, ContactsTab, ItemsTab
- ✅ Click-to-call — phone numbers wrapped in `tel:` links in ContactsTab
- ✅ Cadence carry-forward stopgap — "Log Task" button on task cadences in CadenceView (List, Calendar views)
- ✅ Quick notes scratchpad — editable textarea for `account.objective` on Overview tab, auto-saves on blur
- ✅ Follow-up due date — surfaces `follow_up_date` from last meeting on Overview; overdue badge on account cards
- ✅ Health auto-score — calculated green/yellow/red from days since last contact, overdue items, follow-up status; shown alongside manual status on Overview
- ✅ Brief Me modal — "✦ Brief Me" button on account detail header; Pip generates pre-call brief (last meeting, open items, contacts, sharp observation); caches per account
- ✅ Multi-select email contacts — checkboxes on Contacts tab; "Email Selected" builds mailto with all checked addresses
- ✅ Rebrand to Folios — product name changed from Folio to Folios across all user-facing copy, PWA manifest, page title, invite emails, print export, Pip system prompts (Folios + Gauge). "Briefcase Suite" framing dropped; Folios is now the umbrella with Lanyard/Gauge as connected modules. Domain `folioshq.com` live on Vercel/Porkbun.

## Ripped (deliberate simplification)

Personal Mode focus. Schema stays for future re-build when corporate data integration lands.

- 🪓 **Pipeline V2 + Revenue History + Shop Metrics + revenue surfaces (May 2026)** — the Pipeline nav item, `PipelineView`, Log Month modal, MoM/YoY deltas, sparklines on account cards, MoM trend arrows, revenue display in account card meta + account detail header, Revenue YTD + Revenue Trend + Shop Connections cards on Overview, revenue input on AddAccountModal, Shop Metrics overlay, `useAccountMetrics` hook, financial helpers in `metricsUtils.js` (`displayRevenue`, `fmtRevenue`, `momPct`, `yoyPct`, `momDelta`, `fmtPct`, `fmtDelta`, `latestRecord`, `accountRecords`, `MONTH_NAMES`, `parseRevenueText`), `metricsUtils.test.js`, "revenue" sort option, pipeline mark in Onboarding tour, Pipeline filters from the wishlist, "Revenue/tier/pipeline don't apply" notes in Pip context, revenue/shop secondary-signal sentences in `accountInsights.jsx`, `revenueTrend` + `shopConnections` in PipView context payload. DB columns (`revenue`, `revenue_amount`, `folio_revenue_history`, `folio_shop_metrics`) intact. ShopsTab on MSO accounts stayed (operational child shop list). `pickV` survives in `metricsUtils.js` because it's reused across non-financial insight builders. The `pipeline` glyph in `Mark.jsx` stays in the family. Why: Folios is a notepad-on-steroids / external brain — revenue surfaces showed empty data and made the app feel busy without delivering value. Compliance blocks real revenue ingestion for the foreseeable future; git history is the safety net.

**Security hardening — shipped in code, two items need Supabase dashboard toggle:**

- ✅ Rate limiting on Pip API (20 req/min per user, in-memory)
- ✅ Hardcoded anon key removed — env vars only
- ✅ Audit log SQL written (`supabase/audit_log.sql`) — run when ready
- ✅ Session timeout — 60 min inactivity auto-logout
- ✅ Password strength enforcement — 8 chars, uppercase, number required on signup
- ⚙️ **Email verification** — enable in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Settings → "Enable email confirmations"
- ⚙️ **2FA (TOTP)** — enable in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Settings → "Enable MFA"
- 🔜 Active sessions page — UI to view/revoke sessions (not yet built)

## Feature Wishlist / Roadmap

High and medium priority items are now in the **Pending Updates** queue above.

### Cadence (once built)
- [ ] **Cadence analytics** — meeting frequency per account, open item age, account health trends over time, Pip flags accounts untouched in 30+ days. Hold until enough data exists to make it meaningful.
- [ ] **Power BI integration** — connect Supabase directly to Power BI via Postgres connection string for full dashboard reporting. No special integration needed, just expose the DB connection. Hold until data volume justifies it.

### Future / bigger features
- [ ] **Render thrash detector** — Phase 6 observability catches React errors and uncaught exceptions, but it doesn't catch infinite render/refetch loops (the app isn't crashing, just spinning). Example bite: the Activity dropdown strobing because `fromDate` recomputed `Date.now()` every render → filters identity changed → useActivity refetched in a loop. The error boundary never fired. Idea: lightweight render-rate detector at the App level — if a hook's effect fires > N times in M seconds, log a `error_type='render_thrash'` row to `folio_errors` with the suspicious hook name + stack. Surfaces silent perf disasters before users notice the fans spinning. Not v1.
- [ ] **Lanyard real auth** — connect Lanyard users to Folios users via Supabase Auth
- [ ] **Lanyard → Folios live sync** — post-conference notes flow into Folios automatically once auth is shared
- [ ] **CRM integrations** — Salesforce / HubSpot sync
- [ ] **Mobile app** — React Native wrapper or PWA improvements
- [ ] **Revenue-impact Update Calendar v3 — Ambitious (supplier webhook / portal / email parser)** — deferred follow-up. The v1 build (manual entry + external_event type) shipped — see Already shipped: Revenue-impact Update Calendar. v3 would add an auto-ingestion lane so supplier-side and customer-internal changes get logged without manual entry. Big lift; revisit when v1 has enough data to prove the value.

## Open TODOs

- [ ] Add real Supabase Auth to Lanyard
- [ ] Run `notifications` and `messages` SQL in Supabase to activate Lanyard features
- [ ] Connect Folios and Lanyard bidirectionally once Lanyard has real auth
