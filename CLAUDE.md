# Folio — Claude Development Context

## Deployment Rule
**Always push directly to `main`.** Vercel auto-deploys on push to main. Never use feature branches unless Chris explicitly asks. If the session was configured with a feature branch, push to main anyway: `git push origin HEAD:main`.

## The Briefcase Suite

Briefcase is a suite of three apps built around account management, conference work, and project tracking. Folio is the hub — Lanyard and Gauge are spokes that punch out from Folio and feed data back.

- **Folio** (`chrisvasconcellos97/Folio`) — year-round account management. Accounts, meetings, pipeline, contacts, open items, Pip AI. The hub.
- **Lanyard** (separate repo) — conference-specific app. Schedule, partner profiles, team chat, personal meeting notes, Pip AI. Punches out from Folio during conferences, feeds notes and partner data back.
- **Gauge** (not yet built) — project management. Tracks commitments and deliverables from account meetings (Phase 1), then expands to company-wide product team integration where PMs manage work and AMs are linked to relevant projects (Phase 2). Feeds project status back into Folio account views.

All three apps share the **same Supabase project**: `https://yrpdjmyfidhxlpmxasao.supabase.co`

### Gauge — Build Notes
- Phase 1: AM-facing. Commitments from meetings graduate into tracked projects in Gauge, visible on the account in Folio.
- Phase 2: Company-wide. Product team uses Gauge as their primary tool, AMs linked to relevant projects. Get input from OEC product team and PMs before building Phase 2 — they'll know what's missing.
- Same security model as Folio and Lanyard — shared Supabase, RLS, 2FA inherited automatically.

## Folio — Current State

- React + Vite, deployed on Vercel, live as of May 2026
- Supabase Auth (real email/password accounts)
- Tables: `folio_accounts`, `folio_contacts`, `folio_meetings`, `folio_items` — all with RLS tied to `auth.uid()`
- `folio_meetings` has two extra columns added post-launch: `pip_summary text`, `pip_email text`
- Pip AI proxy at `api/pip.js` using `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel env vars
- Schema is in `supabase/schema.sql` — run in production
- ABPA 2026 import is in `supabase/import_lanyard.sql` — run in production
- 11 accounts and 8 meetings imported from Lanyard with Pip summaries and draft emails attached

---

## Lanyard — Architecture Summary

- React + Vite, hosted on Vercel (separate deployment)
- **No real auth** — uses anonymous user IDs (`lanyard_uid`) generated and stored in `localStorage`
- Supabase accessed via raw REST fetch calls (no SDK), anon key hardcoded in `App.jsx`
- Single-file app: `src/App.jsx` (~4300 lines)

### Storage pattern
- **Writes to localStorage immediately** for speed, then debounces a Supabase upsert 1.5 seconds later
- **On load**: checks Supabase first, falls back to localStorage if nothing found

### Supabase tables (Lanyard)

| Table | user_id value | What's stored |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| `sessions` | `"abpa2026_team"` | Conference schedule events (shared) |
| `partners` | `"abpa2026_team"` | Partner/account profiles (shared) |
| `user_prefs` | `"u_<uid>"` | Hotel info, quick notes (personal) |
| `user_prefs` | `"u_<uid>_notes"` | Personal meeting notes per session (private) |
| `share_codes` | — | Temporary codes for syncing between teammates |
| `notifications` | — | Team activity feed (built, SQL not yet run) |
| `messages` | — | Team chat, DMs, shoutouts (built, SQL not yet run) |

### The auth problem
`lanyard_uid` lives in localStorage — clearing the browser or switching devices loses personal notes. Shared data (under `"abpa2026_team"`) is safe. **Adding real Supabase Auth to Lanyard is the top priority for the next Lanyard build.**

---

## Folio ↔ Lanyard Integration — Current Status

- Lanyard ABPA 2026 partner data and meeting notes have been imported into Folio
- Going forward, Lanyard will need real auth before bidirectional sync makes sense

---

## Pip

Both apps use the same Pip personality — a loyal, slightly anxious field analyst. Pip has access to account/meeting context injected into the system prompt. Model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

### Pip cost strategy
- Generate Pip outputs once, save to DB (`pip_summary`, `pip_email` columns)
- Never regenerate what's already saved — load from DB instead
- Future "Ask Pip" button should check for existing output before making an API call

---

## Supabase

- Project URL: `https://yrpdjmyfidhxlpmxasao.supabase.co`
- Same project for both Folio and Lanyard
- Folio tables have proper RLS via `auth.uid()`
- Lanyard tables use text `user_id` fields (not auth UUIDs)

---

## Scalability Notes

This app is currently single-user but should be built with multi-tenancy in mind from the start. Every decision should assume it will eventually serve multiple businesses with multiple users per business.

- **RLS is already user-scoped** — good foundation, but team/org layer will be needed
- **Future: add `org_id` to all tables** — one org per business, users belong to orgs, RLS updates to match
- **Pip at scale** — Haiku is cheap but at volume, saved outputs (never re-call for same meeting) are essential
- **Avoid hardcoding user IDs** — `import_lanyard.sql` has a hardcoded user ID for one-time import only, never repeat this pattern in app code
- **Keep hooks thin** — data logic lives in `/hooks`, components stay presentational
- **Schema changes** — always add columns with `if not exists`, never destructive migrations

---

## Development Workflow

- Features requested by Chris go on **Pending Updates** list below
- Chris says "ship it" → everything on the list gets built in one batch
- Items drop off the list after they ship
- If items should be grouped for efficiency, suggest it before executing
- Never execute immediately on a feature request — queue it first

---

## Pending Updates

1. **Quick Tasks** — fast capture for urgent, day-of items. "+ Quick Task" button on the main accounts page only. Tap it, add a title and optional details (customer name, phone, notes), optionally set a same-day reminder time. Tasks live in a lightweight tray on the main page — open tasks show above the accounts list, collapse when all done. Tap any task to expand, edit, mark done, or promote it into a full account/meeting. Designed for the "someone just called me and I can't do this right now" moment. Schema: `folio_quick_tasks` table with `id, user_id, title, notes, reminder_at, done, created_at`.
2. **Sub-accounts migration** — UI and code are fully built. Just needs the `parent_account_id` column added in Supabase: `alter table folio_accounts add column if not exists parent_account_id uuid references folio_accounts(id);` — run this in the Supabase SQL editor to activate the feature.

**Already shipped (drop from list):**
- ✅ Pip Summarize with date range (30d / 90d / all time presets, saves to account)
- ✅ Cadence (full nav item, per-account editor, calendar view, open items carry forward)
- ✅ Last interaction tracking (`last_interaction_at` drives days counter on account cards)

**Security hardening — shipped in code, two items need Supabase dashboard toggle:**

- ✅ Rate limiting on Pip API (20 req/min per user, in-memory)
- ✅ Hardcoded anon key removed — env vars only
- ✅ Audit log SQL written (`supabase/audit_log.sql`) — run when ready
- ✅ Session timeout — 60 min inactivity auto-logout
- ✅ Password strength enforcement — 8 chars, uppercase, number required on signup
- ⚙️ **Email verification** — enable in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Settings → "Enable email confirmations"
- ⚙️ **2FA (TOTP)** — enable in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Settings → "Enable MFA"
- 🔜 Active sessions page — UI to view/revoke sessions (not yet built)

## Feature Wishlist / Roadmap

### High priority
- [ ] **"Ask Pip" button on meetings** — generates summary, cleaned notes, draft email on demand; saves result to `pip_summary` / `pip_email` so it's never regenerated
- [ ] **Pip context improvement** — pass full account history (all meetings, open items, contacts) into Pip system prompt for richer responses
- [ ] **Revenue field formatting** — currently free text, should be a number field with proper formatting and sorting
- [ ] **Last meeting auto-update** — when a meeting is logged, auto-set `last_meeting` on the account

### Medium priority
- [ ] **Business card scanner** — "Scan Card" button in Add Contact opens camera, sends image to Claude vision via new `api/scan-card.js`, auto-fills name/title/phone/email/linkedin. Smart account matching: fuzzy-match extracted company name against existing `folio_accounts` — if match found, show "Looks like [Account Name] — add to this account?" with one-tap confirm; if no match, prompt to create a new account. Ideal for post-conference intake.
- [ ] **Email integration** — one-tap to open draft follow-up email in mail client (`mailto:` link pre-populated)
- [ ] **Open items on meetings** — when logging a meeting, action items should optionally auto-create open items
- [ ] **Account search improvement** — search across contacts and notes, not just account name
- [ ] **Pipeline filters** — filter by tier, status, revenue range
- [ ] **Notifications / reminders** — flag accounts with no contact in X days, overdue items

### Cadence (once built)
- [ ] **Cadence analytics** — meeting frequency per account, open item age, account health trends over time, Pip flags accounts untouched in 30+ days. Hold until enough data exists to make it meaningful.
- [ ] **Power BI integration** — connect Supabase directly to Power BI via Postgres connection string for full dashboard reporting. No special integration needed, just expose the DB connection. Hold until data volume justifies it.

### Briefcase Landing Page
- [ ] **Separate repo: `chrisvasconcellos97/Briefcase`** — standalone marketing/intro page for the full suite. Interactive icon selector to preview each app, live link to Folio, suite overview. Pitch line: "From the conference floor to year-round relationships. One suite. Powered by Pip." Reference image saved in Chris's previous Claude chat showing the three-app layout with Folio center, Lanyard left, Gauge right, SYNC connectors between them.

### Future / bigger features
- [ ] **Team support** — org layer, multiple users per account, shared accounts
- [ ] **Lanyard real auth** — connect Lanyard users to Folio users via Supabase Auth
- [ ] **Lanyard → Folio live sync** — post-conference notes flow into Folio automatically once auth is shared
- [ ] **CRM integrations** — Salesforce / HubSpot sync
- [ ] **Mobile app** — React Native wrapper or PWA improvements

## Open TODOs

- [ ] Add real Supabase Auth to Lanyard
- [ ] Run `notifications` and `messages` SQL in Supabase to activate Lanyard features
- [ ] Connect Folio and Lanyard bidirectionally once Lanyard has real auth
