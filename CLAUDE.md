# Folios — Claude Development Context

## Deployment Rule
**Vercel production branch is `claude/build-folio-desktop-app-XzvZ5`.** Always push to both `main` AND this branch on every commit:
```
git push origin HEAD:main
git push origin HEAD:claude/build-folio-desktop-app-XzvZ5
```
**Do NOT push to any other branches** — every branch push counts toward Vercel's deployment limit. Now on Pro plan so limit is much higher, but still avoid unnecessary branch pushes.

## Font Rule
**Never use Google Fonts CDN.** All fonts must be self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable` packages installed through npm and imported in `src/main.jsx`. Google Fonts calls get blocked by corporate network proxies. Current fonts: `@fontsource-variable/inter`, `@fontsource-variable/fraunces`, `@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono`.

## Patch — Background Build Agent

**Patch** is the name for the background agent used to execute large batch builds. When a batch of queued items is ready to ship, spawn Patch via the Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"` so it works in a clean copy of the repo without disrupting the main conversation.

- Patch handles the building, Claude handles the thinking
- Use Patch for multi-file batches (5+ files) to keep the main context clean
- Patch commits and pushes to `main` when done — one clean commit per batch
- The stop hook has a 10-minute grace period so Patch can work without triggering mid-batch commits

## Architecture

**Folios is the umbrella product** — a year-round account management app. Lanyard and Gauge are connected modules that live inside the Folios world, not separate apps with equal billing. The product name is **Folios** (plural); the GitHub repo is still named `Folio` (singular) for historical reasons — don't rename the repo.

- **Folios** (`chrisvasconcellos97/Folio`) — the main app. Year-round account management: accounts, meetings, pipeline, contacts, open items, Pip AI. Production domain: `folioshq.com`.
- **Lanyard** (separate repo) — conference-specific module. Schedule, partner profiles, team chat, personal meeting notes, Pip AI. Punches out from Folios during conferences, feeds notes and partner data back.
- **Gauge** (lives under `gauge/` in this repo) — project management module. Tracks commitments and deliverables from account meetings (Phase 1), then expands to company-wide product team integration where PMs manage work and AMs are linked to relevant projects (Phase 2). Feeds project status back into Folios account views.

All three share the **same Supabase project**: `https://yrpdjmyfidhxlpmxasao.supabase.co`

### Gauge — Build Notes
- Phase 1: AM-facing. Commitments from meetings graduate into tracked projects in Gauge, visible on the account in Folios.
- Phase 2: Company-wide. Product team uses Gauge as their primary tool, AMs linked to relevant projects. Get input from OEC product team and PMs before building Phase 2 — they'll know what's missing.
- Same security model as Folios and Lanyard — shared Supabase, RLS, 2FA inherited automatically.

---

## Folios — Current State

- React + Vite, deployed on Vercel at `folioshq.com`, live as of May 2026
- Supabase Auth (real email/password accounts)
- Tables: `folio_accounts`, `folio_contacts`, `folio_meetings`, `folio_items` — all with RLS tied to `auth.uid()`. (Table names keep the `folio_` prefix — they're DB identifiers, not user-facing brand.)
- `folio_meetings` has two extra columns added post-launch: `pip_summary text`, `pip_email text`
- Pip AI proxy at `api/pip.js` using `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel env vars
- Schema is in `supabase/schema.sql` — run in production
- ABPA 2026 import is in `supabase/import_lanyard.sql` — run in production
- 11 accounts and 8 meetings imported from Lanyard with Pip summaries and draft emails attached

---

## Lanyard — Architecture Summary

- React + Vite, hosted on Vercel (separate deployment)
- **No real auth** — uses anonymous user IDs (`lanyard_uid`) generated and stored in `localStorage`
- Supabase accessed via raw REST fetch calls (no SDK), anon key hardcoded in `App.jsx`
- Single-file app: `src/App.jsx` (~4300 lines)

### Storage pattern
- **Writes to localStorage immediately** for speed, then debounces a Supabase upsert 1.5 seconds later
- **On load**: checks Supabase first, falls back to localStorage if nothing found

### Supabase tables (Lanyard)

| Table | user_id value | What's stored |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| `sessions` | `"abpa2026_team"` | Conference schedule events (shared) |
| `partners` | `"abpa2026_team"` | Partner/account profiles (shared) |
| `user_prefs` | `"u_<uid>"` | Hotel info, quick notes (personal) |
| `user_prefs` | `"u_<uid>_notes"` | Personal meeting notes per session (private) |
| `share_codes` | — | Temporary codes for syncing between teammates |
| `notifications` | — | Team activity feed (built, SQL not yet run) |
| `messages` | — | Team chat, DMs, shoutouts (built, SQL not yet run) |

### The auth problem
`lanyard_uid` lives in localStorage — clearing the browser or switching devices loses personal notes. Shared data (under `"abpa2026_team"`) is safe. **Adding real Supabase Auth to Lanyard is the top priority for the next Lanyard build.**

---

## Folios ↔ Lanyard Integration — Current Status

- Lanyard ABPA 2026 partner data and meeting notes have been imported into Folios
- Going forward, Lanyard will need real auth before bidirectional sync makes sense

---

## Pip

Both Folios and Lanyard use the same Pip personality — a loyal, slightly anxious field analyst. Pip has access to account/meeting context injected into the system prompt. Model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

### Pip cost strategy
- Generate Pip outputs once, save to DB (`pip_summary`, `pip_email` columns)
- Never regenerate what's already saved — load from DB instead
- Future "Ask Pip" button should check for existing output before making an API call

---

## Supabase

- Project URL: `https://yrpdjmyfidhxlpmxasao.supabase.co`
- Same project for Folios and Lanyard
- Folios tables have proper RLS via `auth.uid()`
- Lanyard tables use text `user_id` fields (not auth UUIDs)

---

## Scalability Notes

This app is currently single-user but should be built with multi-tenancy in mind from the start. Every decision should assume it will eventually serve multiple businesses with multiple users per business.

- **RLS is already user-scoped** — good foundation, but team/org layer will be needed
- **Future: add `org_id` to all tables** — one org per business, users belong to orgs, RLS updates to match
- **Pip at scale** — Haiku is cheap but at volume, saved outputs (never re-call for same meeting) are essential
- **Avoid hardcoding user IDs** — `import_lanyard.sql` has a hardcoded user ID for one-time import only, never repeat this pattern in app code
- **Keep hooks thin** — data logic lives in `/hooks`, components stay presentational
- **Schema changes** — always add columns with `if not exists`, never destructive migrations

---

## Development Workflow

- Features requested by Chris go on **Pending Updates** list below
- Chris says "ship it" → everything on the list gets built in one batch
- Items drop off the list after they ship
- If items should be grouped for efficiency, suggest it before executing
- Never execute immediately on a feature request — queue it first
- **Before shipping items 4–7:** do a full layout audit first — review placement, spacing, and information hierarchy across every screen to make sure new features land cleanly into a well-organized foundation

### Idea Capture Rule (read this every session)

**Nothing Chris mentions gets discarded.** Ideas have been lost across chats — this is the fix.

- **Capture aggressively, not selectively.** If Chris says "could we also...", "what about...", "I'd love...", "I'm wondering if...", "would be nice to have...", or even floats a half-formed idea mid-conversation → it goes into **Pending Updates** or **Feature Wishlist / Roadmap** *that same turn*, before responding to anything else.
- **Even rejected/deferred ideas get logged** in the Wishlist with a one-line note on why deferred — so they resurface if context changes.
- **Asides count.** "Side note, the Departments thing would be cool" → that's an idea, capture it.
- **Tangents in the middle of another feature discussion count.** If Chris is walking through Cadence Hub and mentions a Departments tab → capture Departments immediately, don't lose it in the Cadence Hub conversation.
- **When in doubt, log it.** A half-captured idea is recoverable. A forgotten idea is gone.
- **Confirm capture out loud** when you log something new mid-conversation: "Queued under [section]." So Chris sees it landed.

## Pending Updates

1. **Pipeline V2 + Revenue History + Shop Metrics:**
   - Revenue field formatting — convert free-text revenue to a number type with currency display + proper sorting

2. **Code quality:** *(no open items)*

3. **Feature completeness:**
   - "Ask Pip" button on meetings — generates summary, cleaned notes, draft email on demand; caches to `pip_summary` / `pip_email` so it's never regenerated
   - Pip context improvement — pass full account history (all meetings, open items, contacts) into Pip system prompt
   - Auto-create open items from meeting action items — checkbox in Add Meeting modal to promote each action item to an open item
   - In-app notification banner — shows on login: accounts gone cold, items overdue, follow-ups due this week
   - **Cadence Hub** — per-cadence all-access workspace. Locked spec:
     - **Schema:** add `cadence_id` (nullable uuid → `folio_cadences`), `method` ('phone'|'email'|'video'|'in_person'), `status` ('draft'|'summarized') to `folio_meetings`.
     - **Rename:** "Log Meeting" → "Log Conversation" everywhere (account detail button, quick actions banner `+ Meeting` → `+ Conversation`). DB stays `folio_meetings`.
     - **Log Conversation modal:** method dropdown + cadence dropdown. If account has cadences → cadence required (all conversations filter into the hub). If account has no cadences → conversation logs without a cadence and lives in the account's Meetings tab.
     - **Hub layout (desktop):** opens from CadenceView (calendar/week/list) and account detail page. Sections top-to-bottom — Pip brief (cached + manual refresh) → Active drafts → "+ New conversation" → Meeting history (this cadence) → All open items on account → Scheduled follow-ups.
     - **Hub layout (mobile):** compact header (cadence name, last/next, Pip brief collapsed one-liner that taps to expand). 4-tab segmented control below: **Notes** (default — active drafts + new conversation) / **History** / **Tasks** / **Follow-ups**.
     - **Drafts:** running scratchpad per meeting, private to author. Multiple drafts can coexist. Stale flag for drafts >7 days unsummarized. Summarize → Pip generates summary + action items (with optional promised dates) + follow-up dates → status flips to 'summarized', moves into history. Summarized meetings stay editable.
     - **Cadence next-due:** auto-advances when a conversation is logged tied to it.
     - **Account Meetings tab:** stays as all-cadence rollup view (and home for cadence-less conversations on accounts without cadences set up).
     - **Backfill:** one-time per-account prompt to assign cadences to existing meetings.
     - **Open discussion (not in v1):** how action items / promised deliveries feed into Gauge.
   - **Departments tab** — internal-teams workspace (marketing, sales, product, ops, etc). Click a department → full hub for working notes, tasks, conversations with team leads, optional cadences. Two modeling options to decide before build: (a) separate top-level concept with new `folio_departments` table, distinct nav, no revenue/shop fields — clean separation; (b) reuse `folio_accounts` with `account_type = 'internal_team'` alongside `mso`/`shop` — free reuse of Cadence Hub, conversations, contacts, Pip stack. Lean toward (b) so internal teams inherit the same workflow muscle, with conditional UI hiding revenue/shop sections for `internal_team` type. Decide whether to fold into Cadence Hub build or ship after.

## Feature Wishlist / Roadmap

High and medium priority items are now in the **Pending Updates** queue above.

### Cadence (once built)
- [ ] **Cadence analytics** — meeting frequency per account, open item age, account health trends over time, Pip flags accounts untouched in 30+ days. Hold until enough data exists to make it meaningful.
- [ ] **Power BI integration** — connect Supabase directly to Power BI via Postgres connection string for full dashboard reporting. No special integration needed, just expose the DB connection. Hold until data volume justifies it.

### Future / bigger features
- [ ] **Lanyard real auth** — connect Lanyard users to Folios users via Supabase Auth
- [ ] **Lanyard → Folios live sync** — post-conference notes flow into Folios automatically once auth is shared
- [ ] **CRM integrations** — Salesforce / HubSpot sync
- [ ] **Mobile app** — React Native wrapper or PWA improvements

---

## Open TODOs

- [ ] Add real Supabase Auth to Lanyard
- [ ] Run `notifications` and `messages` SQL in Supabase to activate Lanyard features
- [ ] Connect Folios and Lanyard bidirectionally once Lanyard has real auth
